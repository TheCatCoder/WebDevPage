        <h3>Welcome to Daniel Musser's 1430 Course Work page!</h3>

        <p>In this class, I was able to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they interact with each other. We practised writing code that implemented the main concepts from each of those three. We did this by submitting "mini projects" almost every week on a site called CodePen. There are links below to 3 of my mini projects.</p>

        <a href="http://codepen.io/spandan22/full/bVENER/">HTML EXAMPLE |</a>
        <a href="http://codepen.io/spandan22/full/NGGvXM/">CSS EXAMPLE |</a>
        <a href="http://codepen.io/spandan22/full/wKZver/">JAVASCRIPT EXAMPLE</a>

        <p>Near the end of the semester, my class was asked to write an essay on  the legal or social impacts that the internet has had on society. I chose to write my paper about the way that the internet has affected the music industry since I myself am a musician. The PDF link for my paper can be found below.</p>

        <a href="The%20Internet%20and%20Musicians.pdf">THE INTERNET AND MUSICIANS</a>

        <p>All of this learning culminated in the creation of a final project website. My project website focused on a personality test called "The Cube Test". I hosted it using GitHub and you can visit it through the link below.</p>

        <h3>Course Reflection</h3>

        <p>I took this course because SLCC indicated that it could be used to fulfil part of my General Education requirements, and also because I felt that it would be fun and useful to know a little bit more about website design development. What I didn't anticipate is how useful it has been for my other programming tasks for me to learn more about web development. For example, I had been trying to learn how to manipulate a webpage using Powershell (a windows application that allows you to script certain computer tasks so that it can be done faster and without having to use the UI for the scripted application), knowing about how the DOM works and having manipulated my own webpages using Javascript made the whole task quite a bit more understandable. As I learn more about other programming languages in my free time, I can see that the knowledge and experience gained from this class will continue to be useful as I learn even more about programming and eventually start a career in a computer science field.</p>
